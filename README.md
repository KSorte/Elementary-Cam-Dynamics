# Elementary-Cam-Dynamics
This code was written in response to a problem in Theory of Machines. 
This is a MATLAB program for a flat-faced-follower-eccentric cam system using input data - cam eccentricity, spring stiffness, preload, effective follower mass, angular speed, and interval length 
for numerical calculationâ€“ to create a force array. Friction is neglected everywhere.
If the angular speed exceeded jump off speed, the program calculates the lift off and touch down angles numerically using NEWTON-RHAPSON method for finding roots.
